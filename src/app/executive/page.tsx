            Senior Pastor of Word Tabernacle Church located in
             Rocky Mount, North Carolina. At the intersection of
              pastoral ministry and public policy he has formed 
              a collaborative model of human, socio-political- 
              economic and community development,
               another avenue by which he has accomplished
                this was by serving two consecutive terms 
                in the North Carolina General Assembly, 
                becoming “living history” as the only person 
                of color to be elected to represent House District 25 
                (Nash-Rocky Mount). As a Commissioner of MyFutureNC, 
                he is one of the architects of the
                 statewide educational attainment goal.
