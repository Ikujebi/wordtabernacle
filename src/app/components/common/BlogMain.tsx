          Obedience to God qualifies one for His blessings. God does not solely
          use the qualified. He qualifies those who make themselves available
          for His work. And strict obedience to His injunctions attracts being
          qualified by Him. Check and do the needful.

          A refuge guards things within it and a fortress shields its contents
          from external intrusion. God is our refuge and fortress, connoting
          that challenges might be happening around us but God will protect us
          from them all, never to be affected by any. He/she who has God as
          his/her refuge and fortress enjoys peace of mind, even in trying
          times.

        <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg xl:text-lg mb-4 text-justfy ">
          To say God is All-knowing and most powerful is not an understatement.
          He reigns supreme as the most wise of all and the most powerful.
          Hence, He is Omnipotent and Omniscient. Do you seek wisdom and power
          (which I enjoin you to passionately seek)? Come to God who gives
          liberally and without recounting.
